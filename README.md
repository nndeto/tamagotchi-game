# Scope
The final product will be a Sailor Moon themed Tamagotchi game that the player is able to interact with via clickable buttons. The Tamagotchi will have states of hunger, boredom, and sleepiness that go up at set interval rates. If any of those states reach 10 the Tamagotchi dies. The player is able to stave off death by choosing the best button that corresponds to either feeding, putting to sleep, or playing with the pet.

# Instructions 
1. Start the game, by clicking the start button.
2. Keep the boredom, sleepiness, and hunger stats from reaching ten.
3. Press the play, feed, or sleep buttons to decrease the corresponding rising stats. 
4. Follow the link to get started: https://nndeto.github.io/tamagotchi-game/

# Triumphs
Coding out an ending that allows the player to win if it hits a threshold of twenty. That way the game isn't one continual thing of trying to decrease stats.
Creating dynamic messages that represent the moods of the Tamagotchi and are expressed via a speech bubble and Tamagotchi mascot translator.

# Challenges
I was unable to solve the problem of making my design responsive and allowing my game to look just as good on smaller screens. I experimented with different ratios and sizes but was only ever capable of making parts of the game look good.
