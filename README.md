# Scope
The final product will be a Sailor Moon themed Tamagotchi game that the player is able to interact with via clickable buttons. The Tamagotchi will have states of hunger, boredom, and sleepiness that go up at set interval rates. If any of those states reach 10 the Tamagotchi dies. The player is able to stave off death by choosing the best button that corresponds to either feeding, putting to sleep, or playing with the pet.
